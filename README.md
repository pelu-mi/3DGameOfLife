<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

3D Game of Life is an innovative three-dimensional implementation of Conway's famous cellular automaton, bringing the classic Game of Life into immersive 3D space. This project transforms the traditional 2D grid-based simulation into a dynamic 3D cube world where cellular evolution occurs across three spatial dimensions.

Conway's Game of Life, originally conceived as a 2D cellular automaton, demonstrates how simple rules can create complex, emergent behaviors. This 3D adaptation extends those fascinating principles into volumetric space, creating intricate patterns and behaviors that evolve over time within a 10Ã—10Ã—10 cube grid.

Traditional 2D implementations are limited to flat surfaces with 8-neighbor interactions per cell. Our 3D version expands this concept dramatically, where each cell can interact with up to 26 neighboring cells in three-dimensional space. This fundamental change creates entirely new categories of patterns, from simple 3D oscillators to complex propagating structures that would be impossible in 2D space.

### Core Functionality

 - [x] **3D Cellular Automaton**: Full three-dimensional implementation of Game of Life rules with 26-neighbor interactions

 - [x] **Interactive 3D Navigation**: Complete camera control system with zoom, pan, and rotation capabilities using OrbitControls
 - [x] **Volumetric Grid System**: 10Ã—10Ã—10 cube grid supporting 1,000 simultaneous cellular automata instances
 - [x] **Performance Optimization**: Efficient instanced mesh rendering for handling thousands of cubes simultaneously
 - [x] **Dynamic Visual Effects**: Professional lighting system with spotlight, ambient lighting, and shadow mapping
 - [x] **Space Environment**: Immersive space-themed background textures and atmospheric rendering
 - [x] **Adaptive 3D Rules**: Custom neighbor-counting algorithm optimized for three-dimensional cellular interactions
 - [x] **Responsive Design**: Full-screen immersive experience with automatic window resizing support
 - [x] **Random Generation**: Procedural initial state generation with 20% cell density for optimal pattern emergence
 - [x] **Memory Efficient**: Smart cube positioning system that moves dead cells off-screen rather than deleting them

The application serves as both an educational tool for understanding cellular automata in higher dimensions and a mesmerizing visualization platform for exploring emergent complexity in 3D space. It demonstrates how mathematical concepts can be transformed into interactive, visual experiences that reveal the hidden beauty of algorithmic systems.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up 3D Game of Life locally for development or personal use.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

* **Node.js** (version 18.0 or higher)
  ```sh
  # Check your Node.js version
  node --version
  ```

* **npm** (latest version recommended)
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/pelu-mi/3DGameOfLife.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**
   ```sh
   cd 3DGameOfLife
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the development server**
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

### Build for Production

To create an optimized production build:

```sh
npm run build
```

<!-- USAGE -->
## Usage

### Basic Navigation

1. **Launch Application**: Open the application in your web browser to see the initial 3D grid
2. **Camera Controls**: 
   - **Rotate**: Click and drag to rotate around the 3D grid
   - **Zoom**: Use mouse wheel to zoom in/out
   - **Pan**: Right-click and drag to pan the view
3. **Observe Evolution**: Watch as the cellular automaton evolves automatically every 2 seconds
4. **Reset**: Refresh the page to generate a new random initial configuration

### Interaction Tips

- **Optimal Viewing**: Position the camera at an angle to see both surface and internal cellular activities
- **Pattern Recognition**: Look for recurring patterns, oscillators, and propagating structures
- **3D Perspective**: Rotate frequently to understand the true three-dimensional nature of the patterns
- **Performance**: The application runs at 120fps for smooth real-time visualization

### Understanding the Visualization

- **Green Cubes**: Represent living cells in the current generation
- **Empty Space**: Areas where cells have died or never existed  
- **Dynamic Updates**: The grid automatically evolves based on 3D Game of Life rules
- **Spatial Context**: The space background provides depth perception for better 3D understanding

## 3D Game Rules

The 3D Game of Life extends Conway's original rules into three-dimensional space:

### Traditional 2D Rules (for comparison):
- Any live cell with 2-3 neighbors survives
- Any dead cell with exactly 3 neighbors becomes alive
- All other cells die or remain dead

### 3D Adaptation:
- **Neighborhood**: Each cell has up to 26 neighbors (3Â³ - 1) instead of 8
- **Survival Rule**: A living cell survives if it has exactly 2 or 3 neighbors
- **Birth Rule**: A dead cell becomes alive if it has exactly 3 neighbors
- **Death Rule**: All other cells die from isolation (<2) or overcrowding (>3)

### 3D Pattern Categories:
1. **Still Lifes**: Stable 3D structures that don't change
2. **Oscillators**: Patterns that return to their initial state after a fixed number of generations
3. **Spaceships**: Patterns that translate themselves across 3D space
4. **Complex Propagators**: Unique 3D patterns impossible in 2D space

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Overview

The application follows a modular React architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ GameOfLife.jsx      # Main 3D scene and game loop
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ControlsPanel.jsx   # Future GUI controls interface
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ GameLogic.js        # Pure cellular automaton functions
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ SceneSetup.js       # Three.js scene initialization
â””â”€â”€ App.js                  # Application entry point
```

### Key Technical Features

- **Instanced Rendering**: Uses `THREE.InstancedMesh` for efficient rendering of multiple identical cubes
- **Matrix Transformations**: GPU-accelerated position updates using transformation matrices
- **Memory Optimization**: Dead cells are positioned off-screen rather than deleted and recreated
- **Frame Rate Control**: Implements custom animation loop with 120fps target
- **3D Neighbor Algorithm**: Optimized triple-nested loop for 26-neighbor counting

### Performance Considerations

- Grid size limited to 10Â³ (1,000 cells) for optimal browser performance
- Instanced mesh rendering reduces draw calls significantly
- Custom animation timing prevents unnecessary computations
- Efficient deep cloning using JSON serialization for grid updates
